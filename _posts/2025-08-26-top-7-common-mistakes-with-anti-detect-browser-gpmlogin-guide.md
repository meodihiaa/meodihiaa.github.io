Top Mistakes New Users Make with Anti-Detect Browsers (and How to Avoid Them)

Starting with an Anti-Detect Browser? Avoid These Costly Errors

Utilizing an anti-detect browser, such as GPMLogin, can unlock powerful capabilities. However, for new users, incorrect setup or poor habits can result in bans, account loss, or inefficient workflows.

This article reveals the most common mistakes beginners make — and how to avoid them — so you can start strong and stay safe.

# Mistake 1: Using the Same Fingerprint Settings for All Profiles

Many beginners think changing the proxy is enough. However, browser  **fingerprints**  delve deeper, encompassing fonts, screen size, WebGL, and more.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Duplicate fingerprints across accounts make it easy for platforms to link your activity.

**How to avoid it:**  
Use a browser that generates  **unique, isolated profiles**  like GPMLogin. Each profile should have a separate environment.

# Mistake 2: Forgetting to Clear Cookies and Cache Between Sessions

Cookies, cache, and local storage can leak identity data even when your IP changes.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Cross-account data leakage is a top reason for bans and blocks.

**How to avoid it:**  
Always use a clean profile for each account. GPMLogin automatically  **isolates session data**  between profiles.

# Mistake 3: Skipping Proxy Configuration or Choosing Free Proxies

Your proxy IP is your online address. Using poor-quality or repeated proxies weakens your privacy shield.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Free proxies often get blacklisted or expose your real IP, making anti-detect measures useless.

**How to avoid it:**  
Select a reputable and trustworthy proxy provider. GPMLogin supports easy  **proxy integration**  with multiple formats (SOCKS5, HTTP, etc.).

# Mistake 4: Using Headless Browsers Instead of Real Browsers

Some users try browser automation with headless Chrome or Selenium without realizing how detectable these setups are.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Headless browsers lack real user behavior and are often flagged by platforms like Facebook, Google, or TikTok.

**How to avoid it:**  
Use  **real browser environments**  like GPMLogin, which mimic natural usage and reduce detection risk.

# Mistake 5: Not Understanding Platform Rules

Each platform (Facebook, TikTok, Amazon) has different security systems. Applying a “one size fits all” setup can fail.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
One wrong setting may work on one site but cause blocks on another.

**How to avoid it:**  
Customize each profile to match the platform’s behavior. GPMLogin allows deep configuration for  **custom browser profiles**.

# Mistake 6: Poor Folder Management

Beginners often name their profiles randomly or don’t separate them by project, risking confusion later.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Accidental reuse of the wrong profile or IP leads to bans and chaos.

**How to avoid it:**  
Create folders by project, platform, or client. Use tags and notes in GPMLogin to stay organized.

# Mistake 7: Ignoring Learning Resources

Many users dive in without understanding the basics of fingerprinting, automation, or profile management.

**Why it’s a problem:**  
Without a clear understanding, it’s easy to make invisible mistakes that hurt results.

**How to avoid it:**  
Watch official video guides and tutorials. GPMLogin offers training in  **English, Vietnamese, and Chinese**  to support all users.
