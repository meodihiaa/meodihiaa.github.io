# What browser is better to choose?

So which antidetect browsers offer the best features? When deciding on the best antidetect browser, it’s essential to consider several factors. Firstly, evaluate the scale of your operations and the platforms you frequently use. This will help you determine which browser aligns best with your requirements. Prioritize anonymity and security by selecting a browser that keeps its extension code open and independent of any server. This ensures transparency and reduces the risk of compromising your privacy. So carefully assess these factors and you’ll choose the antidetect browser that works for you best.

Here is a short summary of listed browsers according to their price, free trial, and operating system they use.

# Proxies and Antidetect Browsers

Antidetect browsers hide identity deeper by changing browser characteristics such as client identification data, browser fingerprints, and IP addresses. All in all, proxies and antidetect browsers work well together to safeguard user anonymity and security. Users can rest assured that their online activities remain hidden from prying eyes.
