# Why calculate the cost of using an Anti-detect browser?

In fields like advertising, affiliate marketing, dropshipping, SEO, and game airdrops, using multiple accounts on a single device often leads to bans or account suspensions. Anti-detect browsers are essential tools for managing multiple identities on one device. However, long-term costs are crucial when choosing a browser beyond features.

# Total cost of using an Anti-detect browser for 6–12 months

When comparing platforms, consider the following expenses:

-   Browser license (monthly or one-time payment)
-   Proxy costs (data center or residential)
-   Tool integration & automation fees
-   Support costs (if charged separately)

# GPMLogin: One-time payment, lifetime access

Unlike most competitors, GPMLogin offers a lifetime license with no recurring fees after purchase.

# GPMLogin’s Pricing (No Renewal Fees):

-   Solo Plan: $125 (1 PC)
-   Team 5 Plan: $245 (5 PCs)
-   Team 10 Plan: $405 (10 PCs)
-   Additional team member upgrades start at just $42/PC
-   The cost of purchasing an additional Private Server (permanent) to share profile data within a team or company is ~ $77

Compared to monthly subscription browsers like Multilogin, AdsPower, or Incogniton,… GPMLogin is far more cost-effective in the long run.
