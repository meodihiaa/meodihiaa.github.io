# What is Airdrop?

Airdrop is a marketing campaign used by cryptocurrency projects to distribute tokens or coins (crypto Airdrop) for free. The purpose of this is to increase the project‚Äôs visibility within the community while encouraging people to become active users or investors in the project. This drives the project‚Äôs development. Airdrops gained prominence when the cryptocurrency market boomed alongside the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) trend in 2017. Today, it remains a popular strategy in the crypto industry.

Tokens from projects are usually distributed for free. However, some Airdrops require participants to ‚Äúfarm Airdrops‚Äù or ‚Äúmine Airdrops.‚Äù What is Airdrop farming? What is doing Airdrop? This involves completing specific tasks to receive tokens. These tasks are usually simple, such as sharing project information, following social media pages, or joining community channels. These Airdrops can bring financial benefits to participants if the value of Airdrop coins increases.
