# Why Is Choosing the Right Proxy Important for Antidetect Browsers?

Using an anti-detect browser alone isn’t enough — without a proper proxy, your real IP can still be exposed. Proxies help mask your IP, but not all proxies are the same. Choosing the wrong one can lead to penalties, flagged accounts, or reduced performance.

If you’re into affiliate marketing, ad account farming, crypto airdrops, or multi-account management, pairing the right proxy with your antidetect browser is crucial.

# What Is a Proxy and How Does It Work?

A proxy server acts as a middleman between your device and the internet, assigning you a different IP address. This makes you appear as different users from various locations.

# Types of Proxies

_Datacenter Proxy_

-   Fast & affordable
-   Comes from data centers (not real devices)
-   Easier to detect by platforms

_Residential Proxy_

-   Uses real home IPs
-   Harder to detect, safer for account management
-   More expensive

_Mobile Proxy_

-   Routes through real mobile networks
-   Highest anonymity
-   Most expensive

# Key Factors When Choosing a Proxy

Compatibility with Antidetect Browsers

-   Works seamlessly with GPMLogin (or similar browsers).

IP Type & Rotation Options

-   Static IP: Better for long-term accounts.
-   Rotating IP: Ideal for short-term tasks.

Geo-Targeting

-   Choose proxies with IPs from specific countries for ads or regional accounts if needed.

Speed & Stability

-   Slow/unstable proxies hurt performance — test before buying.

# Tips for Beginners Using Proxies with Antidetect Browsers

-   Never reuse the same proxy across multiple profiles — 1 proxy per profile works best.
-   Avoid free proxies — they’re slow and unreliable.
-   Monitor proxy health and replace if flagged.
