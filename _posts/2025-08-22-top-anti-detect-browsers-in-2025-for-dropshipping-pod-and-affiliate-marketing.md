**Anti-detect browsers**  are becoming essential tools for those working in  **dropshipping**,  **POD**, or  **affiliate marketing**. Avoiding checkpoints, account bans, or IP conflicts is critical when managing multiple profiles and ad accounts. In this article, we’ll explore the best  **anti-detect browsers**  for dropshippers, POD sellers, and affiliate marketers in 2025.

# Why should dropshippers and affiliate marketers use an anti-detect browser?

Because these people often:

-   Create a bulk of  **Facebook ad accounts**
-   Manage a lot of stores on some platforms like Shopee, Amazon, Etsy, or Shopify
-   Run A/B tests with landing pages and campaigns

Creating multiple profiles using a normal browser can lead to checkpoints or IP bans. That’s why an  **anti-detect browser like GPMLogin for Facebook ads**  is essential.
