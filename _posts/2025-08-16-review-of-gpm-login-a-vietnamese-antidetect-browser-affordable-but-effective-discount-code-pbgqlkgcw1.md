# What is GPM Login?

In recent years, the demand for antidetect browsers has been growing in the MMO (Make Money Online) community because it is a relatively cost-effective solution.

For those who are not familiar,  **GPM Login**  is an antidetect browser software that creates a clean and safe environment through multiple profiles. Each profile represents a unique computer setup, helping users stay anonymous on various platforms. This is useful for purposes such as safely maintaining accounts, seeding, participating in airdrops, MMO, POD, etc.

However, most of these types of software are quite expensive, often out of reach for beginners in the MMO world. With a limited budget, optimizing costs is crucial for those just starting out.

After browsing through several groups, I finally came across a name:  **GPM Login**  — a 100% Vietnamese antidetect browser. Some of its notable features include:

-   **Unlimited profiles:**  This is a major plus for  **GPM Login**, as other antidetect browsers typically offer only 1–5 profiles for free. Users must pay extra for more profiles. For activities like airdrops, which can require up to 1000 profiles, the additional costs can be quite high. It’s uncertain if you’ll make money, but the tool itself can be quite expensive.
-   **One-time payment:**  Purchase  **GPM Login**  once and use it forever without monthly subscription fees. This is quite convenient as it eliminates the worry of monthly tool costs.
-   **Automation with GPM ProScript:**  This special tool allows users to create automated scripts for processes like account maintenance without manual intervention. It may be a bit challenging to learn initially, but once set up, it runs stably and can handle multiple profiles simultaneously without freezing or lagging. I used it to run 50 tabs for airdrops smoothly.
-   **Passes major antidetect tests:**  Testing on sites like iphey and pixel scan shows  **GPM Login**  passes all tests, providing peace of mind.
